# Crisees
**Real-Time Monitoring of Social Media Streams to Support Crisis Management**

This repository houses a copy of *Crisees*, my fourth year undergraduate project undertaken at the University of Glasgow, during session 2011-2012. It's a pretty large software project, and consolidates a number of different web applications (and backend tools) to scrape social media platforms, extract content pertenant to an unfolding emergency, and presents it in a simple, intuitive web-based user interface.

I think I'm correct in saying that this tool is one of the first of its kind that was produced (as it was implemented back in 2012), and has paved the way for a number of advancements in this active area of research.

## Publication
Crisees was the subject of a publication at [ECIR 2012](https://dblp1.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ecir/ecir2012.html) in Barcelona, Spain. At the conference, we demonstrated the prototype, which led to interest from a number of different parties. In 2014, I [gave a talk at the University of Glasgow](https://twitter.com/EllaTasm/status/459663804574732288?s=20) about the prototype that I had developed.

## Honours Dissertation
My Honours dissertation on the subject is available on my personal website. [You can find the complete PDF that was submitted to the examiners here.](http://bit.ly/maxwell-honours-pdf)

## Project Status
This project is archived; I am no longer actively maintaining this software. The source code is provided here as-is, and has been put here to show the world *that I can code.*
